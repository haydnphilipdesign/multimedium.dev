## Make it effortless to find information

Residents visit your site when they need something urgently—documents, contact info, updates. Remove scavenger hunts.

### Build a logical information architecture

Group documents by category (governing, financial, forms) and highlight most-used resources. Add search and tags so residents can self-serve quickly.

### Surface urgent updates

Prominently display alerts for weather events, maintenance, or policy changes. Sticky banners or SMS-ready alerts keep everyone aligned.

## Support two audiences: residents & board members

Residents need content, boards need guardrails.

### Streamline board workflows

Give board members approval flows, comment history, and version control so nothing goes live without oversight.

### Provide resident feedback loops

Include forms for maintenance requests, suggestion boxes, and a dedicated contact path for escalations. Automated confirmations build confidence.

## Keep trust with transparency

Residents expect professionalism online just like in person.

### Maintain a consistent update cadence

Share meeting minutes, newsletters, and budget highlights on predictable schedules. A quiet site signals inattention.

### Make compliance automatic

Ensure ADA compliance, follow document retention policies, and add login-based access for sensitive information.

## Partner for ongoing care

HOA boards rotate. Your site shouldn’t fall behind.

### Delegate the heavy lifting

A concierge plan handles document posting, resident requests, and proactive monitoring—so new board members aren’t starting from scratch.

### Review analytics with stakeholders

Quarterly check-ins keep engagement on track. Evaluate portal logins, content views, and support tickets to guide the next improvement.
