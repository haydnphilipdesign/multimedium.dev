## Start with a clear business case

Before diving into pixels and color palettes, start with the moment your visitor opens the homepage. What job are they trying to get done?

### Align the hero with outcomes

Replace vague taglines with direct value statements. Use supporting copy to remove risk (“Same-day quotes”, “Free resident onboarding”, “Five-star reviews”).

### Map the conversion path

Identify every step from landing to conversion. Shorten forms, reduce clicks, and anticipate questions with scannable FAQs instead of PDF downloads.

## Design for skimmability

Your homepage should feel like a well-designed pitch deck. Lead with outcomes, follow with proof, then provide a frictionless call to action.

### Keep layouts lightweight

Component-based design helps you reuse patterns for services, testimonials, and pricing. Pick a typography scale and stick to it.

### Respect mobile realities

More than half of visitors will be on their phones. Use generous tap targets, keep copy short, and avoid hiding essential information behind carousels.

## Build trust faster

A modern design communicates quality. Layer in social proof, process clarity, and transparent pricing so visitors feel confident contacting you.

### Showcase proof early

Put testimonials, certifications, or stats near the top of the page. Show the industries you serve and the outcomes you’ve delivered.

### Make the CTA unmistakable

Pick one or two primary actions—“Book a consult” or “Call now”—and repeat them throughout the page. Always include a phone number that’s tap-to-call.

## Keep iteration simple

Your website should be a living asset, not a 2020 museum piece.

### Use a component library

With Next.js and Tailwind, keeping a consistent component library lets you roll out new landing pages quickly—perfect for seasonal offers or new HOA amenities.

### Measure and improve

Connect analytics, define success metrics, and schedule regular reviews. Ask “What’s the one improvement that increases conversions or resident satisfaction this month?”—then ship it.
