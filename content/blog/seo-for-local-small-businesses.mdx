## Nail the foundations

Local SEO works when the basics are airtight. Start with the assets you control.

### Google Business Profile tune-up

Claim your profile, add real photos, write keyword-rich descriptions, and check that hours are current. Enable messaging if you can respond quickly.

### Consistent NAP everywhere

Name, address, phone number—make sure they match across your website, social media, and directories. Even small inconsistencies can dilute rankings.

## Build location-focused pages

Instead of one generic “Services” page, dedicate content to the neighborhoods or towns you serve.

### Target localized keywords

“HVAC repair in Stroudsburg” beats “HVAC repair” for attracting ready-to-book leads. Use the phrase in headings, copy, and meta descriptions.

### Add trust signals

Include testimonials, project photos, and FAQs specific to each location. Link to related blog posts or case studies to keep visitors exploring.

## Earn and respond to reviews

Reviews influence both rankings and conversions. Make it easy for happy customers to share feedback.

### Automate the ask

Send a review request email or text within 24 hours of service. Include direct links to Google, Yelp, or industry-specific platforms.

### Respond thoughtfully

Thank positive reviewers and address concerns promptly. Prospects read responses as much as the reviews themselves.

## Track what matters

SEO is not set-and-forget. Check analytics monthly to see what’s working.

### Monitor key metrics

Review calls from your Google Business Profile, organic traffic by city, and conversions tied to location pages.

### Iterate quarterly

Update top-performing pages with fresh content, add seasonal promos, and expand into new neighborhoods once the current ones are generating leads.
